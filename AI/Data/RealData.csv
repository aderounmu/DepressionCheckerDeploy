nothing wrong about being alone and happy,0
here we go again,0
"the real reason why you're sad? you're attached to people who have been distant with you. you're paying attention to people who ignore you. you make time for people who are ""too busy"" for you. you're too caring to people who are care less when it comes to you. let those people go",0

"""oh ok"" actually means my heart just got ripped into a million pieces but i won't tell you because you wouldn't care how i feel anyway.",0
"i never really know where i stand in some people's life... one minute they treat me like i'm something special, then nothing the next.",0
the worst feeling is when you find out you didn't mean as much to someone as you thought you did and you look so stupid for caring too much.,0
every night i think about all the mistakes I've made and how much i regret making those decisions because my life could have been different.,0
"the worst type of crying is at night, when everyone's asleep and you have to control it with your hand over your mouth to not make a sound.",0

"all the things i did wrong:

1. i relied on someone for my happiness.
2. i love people more than i love myself.
3. i never asked for help.",0
we hide behind a fake smile to mask the pain but sometimes we wish someone would look closely enough and see how broken we really are inside,0
"typing 'haha' when you can't even smile, acting like you're happy when all you want to do is cry, tell everyone you're okay when you're  not",0
do you ever feel the need to ask someone if they actually still want you in their life because it always feels like they don't really care.,0

"so many people in this world have trust issues because people say ""i'm here for you"" and then run away as soon as things start to fall apart",0
"just because her eyes don't tear up, doesn't mean her heart doesn't cry and just because she comes off strong doesn't mean nothing is wrong.",0
hate getting flashbacks from things you don't want to remember; it feels like your heart suddenly drops and anxiety starts taking over ,0
when i cry about one thing i end up crying about everything that's messed up in my life.,0
it really sucks wanting to talk to someone but you really don't want to annoy anyone because they seem totally fine without you....,0
everything is changing and i don't know where i fit anymore.,0
"they say ""it will get better"" but its a lie... it doesnt get better. you just get used to it.",0

my biggest problem is overthinking everything.,0
"you smile, but you want to cry, you talk but you just want to be quiet. and you pretend that you''re happy, but you aren't.",0
i'm the type of person that one thing can change my mood completely and i can go from confident to insecure in a matter of seconds.,0
"i'm a paradox, neither happy or sad. i smile at pretty things & laugh at funny things, but at night i become a mess of emotions and thoughts",0
Have you ever just randomly started crying because you've been holding in all of these emotions and pretending to be happy for way too long?,0
it hurts so much when you can feel yourself becoming less and less important to the one person who truly means the most to you.,0
"pain changes people, it makes them trust less, overthink more, and shut people out.",0
"have you ever really wanted to ask a question, but you didn't because you knew in your heart that you wouldn't be able to handle the answer?",0
"""you've changed""

try going through what i've gone through and then see if you're the same. pain changes people it makes it harder to trust.",0
"physically, mentally, emotionally tired.",0
Its sad nobody ever knows how much someone is actually hurting... Someone right next to you could be completely broken and you wouldn't know,0
"you're so afraid to tell people how you feel because you fear rejection, so you bury it deep inside yourself where it only destroys you more",0
"my problem is that i start depending on people for my happiness, and when they leave like they always do, they take my happiness with them.",0
"how painful is it to say ""i'm fine"" to the person who's the reason you're broken.",0
one minute everything is okay and the next i have no idea what's going on,0

"i can't stand how quickly my mood changes, it effects my whole life because nobody understands me and people just get really annoyed with me",0
dont come to my gravestone and display emotions which you never once showed to me while i was breathing because that could've kept me alive.,0
"have you been so sad and tired and want to be alone, but at the same time you really wish there was someone who you could talk to who cares.",0
"i'm the girl who pretends people words don't hurt me, just so they don't know how sensitive i really am.",0
"have you ever wanted to cry but no tears came out, so you just stare blankly into space while feeling your heart break into a million pieces",0
i don't really think people understand how stressful it is to explain what's going on in your head when you don't even understand yourself.,0

the worst type of crying is the silent one. the one where you really have to hold your breath and grab your stomach just to keep quiet.,0
she pretends like nothing happened because she wants people to see how strong she is. only she knows how painful and emotional she really is,0
"when i say ""i'm okay"" i want someone to look me in the eyes, hug me tight, and say, ""i know you're not.""",0
"when someone stops talking to me the way they used to, i sit and stress myself thinking if everything else we shared together was just a lie",0
